# SaveYourRecipes
Project to train Angular/Docker/Flask </br>

Operationnal but pretty limited (login, signup, delete, add, modify) </br>

# Future Update

Better UI/UX, Security (SQL injection, hashed password), Possibility to share a recipe (to another user or just the link), Ingredients with measurements, Filters, Images or Video from Link or just from files, Custom profile, </br>
I will also upload it online (using AWS). </br>
