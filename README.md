# SaveYourRecipes

Allow anyone to create an account, log in then view your own saved recipes or to save new one<br />
<br />
A project to train nodeJS, Angular and learn flask, postgreSQL, Docker.<br />
I will deploy it in the future and update it (currently very minimalistic, please don't judge the frontend)<br />
<br />
Missing : log out, hashed password, delete recipes, images (maybe or something to get from link either a video or an image), ingredients<br />
Need to update : frontend, visuals
